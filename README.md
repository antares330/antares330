- 👋  Hi, I’m @antares330 (Justin)
- 👀  I’m interested in music, art, hiking and meditation. **Ohh, and the idea of recursive compression (infinite reversible compression)**

- 🌱  I’m currently learning a few specific tools to work on my projects 😊. Right now, that's Python, Pandas and Regex. Graph/Chart visuals and Julia are both tempting atm

- 💞️  I’m looking to collaborate on entry level projects to get my feet wet and get comfortable with Git (as opposed to hoarding all my .py files locally 😂)
- 📫  How to reach me at Justin@JustinFMiller.com
